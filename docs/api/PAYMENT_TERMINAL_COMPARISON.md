# Payment Terminal Solutions Comparison

## Current Situation: iZettle/PayPal Reader Connect

### Problems Encountered:

1. ❌ **Complex API**: Reader Connect API requires multiple steps (OAuth → Link creation → WebSocket)
2. ❌ **Poor Documentation**: Limited examples, unclear error messages
3. ❌ **Hardware Compatibility**: Only works with new PayPal Reader (not iZettle Reader 2)
4. ❌ **Authentication Issues**: "Invalid code" errors, organization mismatch problems
5. ❌ **Debugging Difficulty**: Opaque error responses, hard to troubleshoot
6. ❌ **Time Investment**: Spent 10+ hours without successful pairing

### What We Tried:

- ✅ OAuth connection (successful)
- ✅ Token encryption/decryption (working)
- ✅ Multiple API endpoints tested
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging
- ❌ Reader pairing (FAILED - "Must be a valid code" error)
