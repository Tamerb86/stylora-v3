## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Local reader DNS vs IP (CSP)

- If DNS resolves correctly, the reader uses `*.stripe-terminal-local-reader.net` and **no IP allowlist is needed**.
- If DNS fails and the SDK falls back to the reader's LAN IP:port, set the server env var `STRIPE_TERMINAL_LOCAL_READER_ORIGINS` (e.g., `https://192.168.10.199:4427,https://192.168.10.199:4428`) so CSP allows the connection.
- Improve DNS resolution to avoid IP fallback: disable VPN/proxy, use router DNS like `1.1.1.1` or `8.8.8.8`, and avoid guest Wi‑Fi/AP isolation that blocks local discovery.

### Reader Not Found

**Problem**: "Ingen lesere funnet" (No readers found)

**Solutions**:

1. ✅ Check reader is powered on
2. ✅ Check WiFi connection on reader
3. ✅ Ensure reader and POS are on same network
4. ✅ Wait 2 minutes after turning on reader
5. ✅ Click "Søk etter lesere" again

### Reader Shows "Offline"

**Problem**: Reader appears in list but status is "Offline"

**Solutions**:

1. ✅ Check WiFi connection on reader
2. ✅ Restart reader (hold power button → restart)
3. ✅ Check Stripe Dashboard for reader status
4. ✅ Contact Stripe support if persistent

### Payment Fails

**Problem**: "Betaling feilet" (Payment failed)

**Common Causes**:

1. ❌ Insufficient funds on card
2. ❌ Card declined by bank
3. ❌ Reader lost connection during payment
4. ❌ Customer removed card too early

**Solutions**:

1. ✅ Ask customer to try again
2. ✅ Try different card
3. ✅ Check reader connection
4. ✅ Restart reader if needed
