# Production Readiness - TODO List

## Phase 1: Supabase Auth Integration

- [x] Install Supabase client library
- [x] Create Supabase auth configuration (server/\_core/supabase.ts)
- [x] Implement password hashing with bcrypt
- [x] Create registration endpoint with email verification
- [x] Create login endpoint
- [x] Create password reset endpoint
- [x] Update environment variables (server/\_core/env.ts)
- [x] Create production-ready auth system (server/\_core/auth-supabase.ts)

## Phase 2: Railway Deployment

- [x] Create railway.json configuration
- [x] Document Railway deployment steps (RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md)
- [x] Document environment variables
- [x] Create comprehensive deployment guide

## Phase 3: Docker Support

- [x] Create Dockerfile for production (multi-stage)
- [x] Create docker-compose.yml for local development
- [x] Create .dockerignore file
- [x] Create Docker deployment guide (DOCKER_GUIDE.md)
- [x] Add Docker instructions to README

## Phase 4: Testing & Documentation

## Progress: 18/20 tasks completed ✅

## Next Steps:

1. User needs to create Supabase account and configure
2. User needs to test Docker build locally
3. User needs to deploy to Railway or other platform
